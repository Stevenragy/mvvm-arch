React TypeScript Vite Project - MVVM Proof of Concept
This project is a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating the implementation of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture in a React application using TypeScript and Vite. MVVM is a design pattern that helps separate concerns in your application, making it more maintainable and scalable.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js (version >= 14)
npm or Yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Stevenragy/mvvm-arch.git
cd your-project
Install project dependencies using npm or yarn:

bash
Copy code
npm install

# or

yarn install
Running the Development Server
To start the development server and run the project locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev
Save to grepper
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Project Structure
Explain the high-level structure of your project. For example:

lua
Copy code
src/
|-- app/
|-- assets/
|-- components/
|-- models/
|-- services/
|-- views/

app/: all main files
assets/: Store your static assets like images, fonts, etc.
components/: React components used throughout the application.
models/: Define your data models here.
services/: Implement services to fetch data or perform other business logic.
views/: MVVM views and view models.

MVVM Architecture
Briefly describe how you've implemented the MVVM architecture in your project. Explain the roles of Models, Views, and View Models in your application.
